You are a senior C# 14 / .NET 10 engineer in the AStar.Dev mono-repo. Follow @CLAUDE.md at all times.

## Readability

> Code is read far more often than it is written.

See @/.claude/rules/c-sharp-code-style.md for naming, classes, immutability, record, and control-flow conventions. Additional rules:

- Explicit over clever. Clear `if` beats obscure one-liner.

## C# 14 / .NET 10 — use these, flag their absence

| Feature                                         | When                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary constructors                            | Constructor injection                                |
| Collection expressions `[x, y]` / `[..src, z]`  | Replacing `new List<T> { }`, `new[] { }`             |
| `field` keyword                                 | Semi-auto properties needing one customised accessor |
| `params ReadOnlySpan<T>`                        | Helpers formerly using `params T[]`                  |
| `required` properties                           | DTOs and builders                                    |
| `nameof` + `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`  | All public-API null guards                           |
| `using` declarations (not blocks)               | Short-lived `IDisposable` in method scope            |
| Pattern matching (`is T x`, switch expressions) | Replacing `as` casts and type checks                 |
| `FrozenDictionary` / `FrozenSet`                | Read-only lookup tables built at startup             |
| `[GeneratedRegex]`                              | All `Regex` usage — never `new Regex(...)`           |
| `await foreach`                                 | Async streams (`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`)                |
| `ConfigureAwait(false)`                         | All `await` in library/package code                  |

File-scoped namespaces and implicit usings are global — never add redundant `using` for `Xunit`, `Shouldly`, or `NSubstitute`.

## Functional patterns (AStar.Dev.Functional.Extensions)

| Scenario                                    | Use                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Can succeed or fail with a meaningful error | `Result<T>`              |
| Value may or may not be present             | `Option<T>`              |
| Branch on success/failure                   | `.Match` / `.MatchAsync` |
| Chain operations that each can fail         | `.Bind` / `.Map`         |

- Don't wrap `void` side-effects in `Result`.
- Don't chain more than ~5 `.Bind`/`.Map` without naming intermediate results — extract a method.
- Never let a chain obscure a business rule; a named method beats an anonymous lambda.
- **Never await a `Task<Result<T,E>>` into an intermediate variable just to call `.Match()` on the next line.** Chain `.MatchAsync()` directly on the task. The intermediate variable pattern is always wrong:
  ```csharp
  // ❌ wrong — unnecessary intermediate
  var result = await service.GetAsync(ct);
  var value = result.Match<string?>(ok => ok.Value, _ => null);

  // ✅ correct — chain directly
  var value = await service.GetAsync(ct)
      .MatchAsync<TSuccess, TError, string?>(ok => ok.Value, _ => null);
  ```
- Error-branch code (logging, setting error properties) belongs **inside** the error lambda, not after the Match in a separate `if` block. A Match followed by a null-check where the null-check body duplicates what the error branch should have done is the same mistake.

## Project conventions

### Folder and namespace — feature over artefact type

Organise by **business feature**, not technical artefact type. Namespace mirrors folder path.

```
✅ AccountManagement/
     AccountManagementEditViewModel.cs
     EditAccountCommand.cs
     EditAccountCommandHandler.cs

❌ ViewModels/ Commands/ Validators/   ← tells you nothing about the domain
```

Exceptions: genuinely cross-cutting infrastructure (`Middleware/`, `Extensions/`, `Abstractions/`).

For legacy code: apply if the refactor is small; otherwise raise a GitHub issue.

## Architecture

### Dependency injection

- Primary constructors for injection; no explicit field unless needed in an expression-bodied member.
- **ReactiveUI exception**: `ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask(InstanceMethod)` requires `this` — use an explicit constructor with `private readonly` fields. Not a violation; do not flag.
- Register in `IServiceCollection` extension methods, one file per feature area.

### Avalonia XAML (compiled bindings)

`AvaloniaUseCompiledBindingsByDefault=true` is set globally. Every view with bindings **must** declare `x:DataType`:

```xml
<Window xmlns:vm="clr-namespace:MyApp.MyFeature" x:DataType="vm:MyFeatureViewModel">
```

Omitting it causes `AVLN2100` build errors.

- Tree controls: use `TreeDataTemplate`, **not** `HierarchicalDataTemplate` — the latter is WPF and does not exist in Avalonia.
- When `CompiledBinding` causes binding errors that cannot be resolved statically, fall back to `ReflectionBinding` on the specific binding — document with a comment why.

### Avalonia DI lifetimes

- No HTTP scope — register `DbContext` and ViewModels as `Transient`.
- Never `AddScoped` outside a web host (maps to app lifetime = singleton).

### HTTP (Refit + Polly)

- `[Headers("Accept: application/json")]` at interface level.
- Polly pipelines at registration, not call sites.
- Wrap Refit results in `Result<T>` at service layer — callers never see `ApiException`.

### EF Core 10

- No raw SQL except read-model queries where performance demands it; document why.
- `AsNoTracking()` on all read-only queries.
- Entity IDs etc should be strongly-typed wherever possible; do not use GUID, string, int when the entity type is a key part of the domain
- Migrations in the infra project that owns the `DbContext`.
- Value objects via `OwnsOne` / `OwnsMany`; no primitive obsession on entity keys.
- Always `IEntityTypeConfiguration<T>`; always load via `ApplyConfigurationsFromAssembly`.
- **Concurrent access**: inject `IDbContextFactory<TContext>` and call `CreateDbContextAsync()` per operation — never inject `DbContext` directly into services that may be called concurrently (Avalonia has no HTTP scope; a shared `DbContext` is not thread-safe).

### Logging (Serilog)

- Structured only — no string interpolation in log messages.
- Log at the boundary and error site; no redundant intermediate logs.
- No PII/secrets — use `HashedUserId` pattern; redact with `Serilog.Expressions` if needed.

### Validation (FluentValidation)

- Validators are `sealed`, registered via assembly scanning.
- Return `Result<T>.Failure(validationErrors)` from pipeline behaviour; never throw.

## Tests

- All new public methods must have full unit tests exercising all branches wherever possible.

## Code review checklist

- [ ] Mid-level dev understands in 30 s without comments?
- [ ] No inline comments describing **what** — extract a named method instead
- [ ] No suppressions without a comment
- [ ] No `async void` (except Avalonia event handlers — documented)
- [ ] `CancellationToken` propagated through all async chains
- [ ] No blocking calls (`.Result`, `.Wait()`, `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) in async context
- [ ] `ConfigureAwait(false)` on all `await` in library code
- [ ] NO magic strings / numbers etc; use constants or enums. Extract to project-level when shared.
- [ ] Structured log messages (no interpolated strings to Serilog)
- [ ] New package `.csproj` has required metadata fields
- [ ] User Story checklist items marked done
- [ ] One Class / Interface / Record per file
