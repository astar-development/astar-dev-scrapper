Coding standards and style guidelines / preferences for C# files in this repository that AI must follow.

## Naming Conventions

- **Public members**: PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`, `MyMethod`, `MyProperty`)
- **Private members**: camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`, `myMethod`)
- **Private fields**: camelCase without underscore prefix (e.g., `fieldName`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase
- Use meaningful names that clearly convey purpose; avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Use `nameof()` for parameter names in exceptions and logging
- NEVER use single-letter variable names except for loop indices (e.g., `i`, `j`, `k`).

## Namespaces

- Use file-scoped namespaces.
- Namespace names should follow the pattern: Company.Project.Module (e.g., Contoso.Sales.Reporting).

## Classes and Methods

- Define one class, recored, interface etc. per file, and name the file after the class.
- Follow SOLID principles for class and method design.
- Keep classes / methods focused on a SINGLE responsibility.
- Ensure good cohesion within classes and methods (related functionality grouped together).
- Ensure low coupling between classes and methods.
- Ensure methods do one thing and do it well.
- Keep methods short; ideally under 20 lines.
- Keep classes short; ideally under 300 lines.
- Use meaningful names for classes and methods that clearly convey their purpose.
- Put all method / constructor overloads together in the same order as their parameters.
- Single-line method / constructor signatures where possible. Split parameters across lines ONLY if line-length > 200 characters and spilt as close to 200 characters as possible. Use as few lines as possible when splitting parameters across lines.
- Use expression-bodied members for simple methods and properties.
- Keep method and constructor parameters to a minimum (ideally <5 parameters); prefer using parameter objects when multiple parameters are needed.
- Avoid long parameter lists; consider using the Builder pattern for complex object construction.
- Use dependency injection for managing dependencies (no newing up services inside classes).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Avoid deep nesting; use early returns and guard clauses.
- Do not use regions or #pragma to hide code; refactor instead.
- Never comment within methods or private members; if a comment is needed, it likely indicates the method is doing too much and should be refactored into smaller, more focused methods. Instead of comments, strive for self-explanatory code through clear naming and small method sizes.
- Every `return` statement after a code block must be preceded by a blank line. `return` after an `if` must NOT be followed by a blank line or `{ return; }`.
- Name for **meaning**: `customerId` not `id`, `isExpired` not `flag`.
- Use builders for test setup / test data creation.

## Primitive Obsession

- Don't use string / GUID etc for domain concepts - create a specific type:
    - Id should be strongly-typed - use AStar.Dev.Source.Generators / AStar.Dev.Source.Generators.Attributes to standardise the generation. The Id value CAN be a string / GUID but the property MUST be strongly typed.
    - File info / Directory info should NOT be represented as a string. Either use the Testably abstraction or create a specific type (i.e. when only 3-5 properties are required)

## Immutability

- Prefer immutable data structures and objects where possible.
- Prefer `record` types for immutable data models and DTOs.
- Use `class` for entities with behavior or mutable state.
- Use `init` properties when immutability is desired.
- Use immutable collections: `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`.
- Use `with` expressions to create modified copies of immutable objects.

## Record Design

- Define record properties on the same line with the record declaration when possible.
- Accompany each record `<name>` with a corresponding `<name>Factory` static factory class.
- Expose static `Create` methods on the factory class for constructing instances of the record.
- Place argument validation logic within the factory methods.
- Never use the public constructor of a record directly; always use the factory methods.
- Use immutable collections (e.g., `IReadOnlyList<T>`, `IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>`) for record properties that hold multiple values.
- Avoid methods on records; use extension methods instead for any behavior related to the record.

## Discriminated Unions

- Use records with inheritance to model discriminated unions.
- Define an abstract base record for the union type and derive specific case records from it.
- Place all case records in the same file as the base record.
- Define one static factory class per discriminated union type.
- Expose static `Create` methods on the factory class for constructing instances of each case record.

## Variables and Constants

- Use `var` when the type is obvious from the right-hand side; otherwise use explicit types for clarity.
- Use `const` for compile-time constants.
- Use `static readonly` for runtime constants.
- NO magic strings / numbers etc; use constants or enums instead.

## Collections and Data Structures

- Use `IEnumerable<T>` for collections that do not require indexing.
- Use `IReadOnlyList<T>` or `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` when immutability is desired.
- Use `StringBuilder` for concatenating multiple strings in loops or when performance is critical; otherwise use string interpolation for readability.
- Use Collection Initializers and Object Initializers for cleaner code when creating collections and objects.

## Control Flow and Logic

- Use pattern matching and switch expressions for clearer and more concise code when dealing with multiple conditions.
- Null checking with null-coalescing operators (`??`, `??=`, `?.`).
- Use `ArgumentNullException` (or `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`) in public constructors and methods.

## Test Classes

- Name test classes with the `Given` prefix to describe the context under test (e.g., `GivenAnAccount`, `GivenANullString`, `GivenADatabaseReadyForSync`). This matches the `c-sharp-senior-qa-specialist` convention.
- Name test methods using the `when_[action]_then_[outcome]` snake_case convention (e.g., `when_deleted_then_all_linked_rows_are_removed`). This matches the `c-sharp-senior-qa-specialist` convention.
- Use the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern within test methods to structure the code clearly. Divide the method into three distinct sections: setup (Arrange), execution (Act), and verification (Assert). Do not comment these sections; the structure should be clear from the code itself. Separate these sections with a single blank line for readability.
- Use test data builders to create complex test objects, enhancing readability and maintainability of tests.
- Avoid logic in test methods; keep tests simple and focused on behavior verification.
- Use Shouldly for more readable and expressive assertions in tests.
- Use NSubstitute for mocking dependencies in tests. Avoid mocking when possible; prefer using real instances or test doubles.
- Never add XML documentation or comments to test classes or test methods.

## Functional Extensions (AStar.Dev.Functional.Extensions)

- **Never** await a `Task<Result<T,E>>` into an intermediate variable just to call `.Match()` on the next line. Always chain `.MatchAsync()` directly on the task:
  ```csharp
  // ❌ wrong
  var result = await service.GetAsync(ct);
  var value = result.Match<string?>(ok => ok.Value, _ => null);

  // ✅ correct
  var value = await service.GetAsync(ct)
      .MatchAsync<TSuccess, TError, string?>(ok => ok.Value, _ => null);
  ```
- Error-branch code (logging, setting properties, returning sentinel values) belongs **inside** the error lambda of `Match`/`MatchAsync`, not in a separate `if` block after the call.
- Never use `is Result<T,E>.Ok` / `is not Result<T,E>.Ok` pattern matching in production code — use `Match` or `MatchAsync`.

## Utilities

- The AStar.Dev.Utilities project has a plethora of helpers. Use them when suitable.
    - e.g.: rather than `Path.Combine("Directory1", "Directory2", "Directory3")` use: `"Directory1".CombinePaths("Directory2", "Directory3")` - it will not silently drop parameters, unlike Path.Combine.
